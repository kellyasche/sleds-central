Here’s how I will do that.\n\nPersonID: change to integer\nK12OrganizationID: change to integer.\nK12EnrTimeID: Change so it’s only the year\nGrade: eliminate - unimportant since we are mostly concerned about whether they graduated.\nEconomicStatusIndicator: I will change this to two categories. Whether they were ever eligible for reduce priced or free meal will be coded as 1 (eligible = codes 1, 2, 4, 5) at any point in the dataset. The remaining will be coded as 0.\nFederalRaceIndicator: eliminate - I’m going to use the RaceEthnicity column instead.\nPSEO columns: I’m most concerned about whether they participated in PSEO or not. A new column will be created indicated whether there was a “Y” coded for either the “PSEOConcurrentEnrollmentIndicator” or “PostSecondaryEnrollmentOptionsIndicator” columns at any point in the dataset. The two original columns will be eliminated.\nStatusEnd: I will only include individuals that have StatusEnd coded as an 8 or 9.\nGender: included and not changed.\nSpecialEdStatus: I will split this into two categories. The first is that a student did not require special education services (codes 1-2) at any point in the dataset. The other category will be that they require special education (codes 4 - 9) at any point in the dataset.\nLimited English: keep with no changes.\nPrimary language: I’m going to create two categories. One being that English is the primary language while the other will be that English is NOT the primary language at any point in the dataset.\nHomeless: Keep with no changes.\n\nWe first need to create a list of all individuals with the StatusEnd code of 8 or 9 (graduated). In addition, we need to remove any student that graduated before 2008. This is because we will not have their full Sophmore - Senior records which is especially important when attempting to identify whether the number of CTE courses taken predicts migration.\nThe other element I want to add is a pre-covid and post-covid variable. All individuals whose grad year is before 2020 will be labeled pre-covid and all others wil lbe post-covid.\nThis “graduates list” will be the list on which we will bind all the other variables.\n\n\nNext we need to create new columns for the variables that will indicate a certain status has been met at any point in the dataset for each PersonID. For example, we want a column that indicates a PersonID was enrolled in PSEO at some point in the dataset. The variables that need a new column created are;\n\nEconomicStatusIndicator\nPostSecondaryEnrollmentOptionsIndicator & PSEOConcurrentEnrollmentIndicator\nSpecialEdStatus\nHomeprimaryLanguage\n\n\n\nNow we can combine the list of graduates with the status indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nK12OrganizationID\nOrganizationName\ncounty.name\ncountyfp\nDem_Desc\nedr\ngrad.year\ngrad.year.covid\nGender\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\nHomelessIndicator\neconomic.status\npseo.participant\nSpecialEdStatus\nnon.english.home\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n5356619\n103290\nLITTLE FALLS SENIOR HIGH\nMorrison\n097\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 5 - North Central\n2013\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n1506121\n201946\nPINE CITY AREA LEARNING CENTER\nPine\n115\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7E- East Central\n2022\nPost-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n1\n0\n0\n0\nUnknown\n\n\n1456500\n44383\nEAGLE VALLEY SECONDARY\nTodd\n153\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 5 - North Central\n2008\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n0\nNA\n0\n0\nHispanic\n\n\n10870895\n100018\nSPECIAL EDUCATION FACILITIES\nStearns\n145\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7W- Central\n2015\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n1\n0\n1\n1\nHispanic\n\n\n1877865\n160881\nMONTICELLO SENIOR HIGH\nWright\n171\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7W- Central\n2016\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n1\n0\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n1323083\n160874\nMONTICELLO SENIOR HIGH\nWright\n171\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7W- Central\n2009\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\nNA\n0\n0\nWhite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nK12OrganizationID\n\n\nOrganizationName\n\n\ncounty.name\n\n\ncountyfp\n\n\nDem_Desc\n\n\nedr\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\ngrad.year.covid\n\n\nGender\n\n\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\n\n\nHomelessIndicator\n\n\neconomic.status\n\n\npseo.participant\n\n\nSpecialEdStatus\n\n\nnon.english.home\n\n\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prepped enrollment data has 137,622 observations and 17 columns.\n\n\n\nSummary of K12Enrollment data\nBelow is the percentage of total observations that;\n\nWere eligible for free or reduced lunch at some point in the dataset\nAre Female\nHave been homeless at some point in the dataset\nHad limited english proficiency at some point in the dataset\nHad non english speakders in home at some point in the dataset\nParticipated in a PSEO course at some point in the dataset.\nPct non white\n\nAs expected, nearly half (49.9%) of the observations are female.

Each observation represents an AP exam taken so this means that a PersonID can be listed multiple times if the individual took multiple AP exams. The ExamGrade is on a 1 - 5 scale with the highest scores being better. According to Meredith at OHE, colleges give credit if the score is 3 or higher.\nI’m a bit torn here. There seems to be three approaches to how I can utilize this data in the model.\n\nI could either just create a category of whether an individual took an AP exam and not care what the grade was.\nI could only use individuals who scored 3 or higher.\nI could keep all the data and change it so that each observation represents a PersonID and new columns created for each AP exam and their score.\n\nFor now, I think I’m going to just utilize option 1 - whether they took an AP exam or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nap.exam\n\n\n\n\n3066282\n1\n\n\n1058834\n1\n\n\n10408742\n1\n\n\n6430656\n1\n\n\n956925\n1\n\n\n872685\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nap.exam\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe updated AP dataset shows that 108,858 took at least one AP exam.

For one particular class, it was consistently labeled “Information Technology” even though the field requires a number value. In addition, “information Technology” doesn’t seem to match the course due to the following information;\nProgram Course Name: Family and Consumer Science Course title: Apparrel CareerCluster: Design CareerClusterName: 6 (which should be a letter value, not a code).\nDue to this information, I recoded anything that was “Information Technology” for that particular course as a “6”.\nIn addition, there were some errors in careercluster 26, which is supposed to be “Administrative only” but had a number of “Youth Apprenticeships” in it that I recoded to CareerCluster 25.\nAfter doing this, the dataset has all individuals/graduates with a column for each CTE course CareerCluster containing the number of courses they took within that CareerCluster. I will summarise below to see how many students took courses within each CareerCluster.\nNow lets join the CTE enrollment data with the master dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\nK12OrganizationID\nOrganizationName\ncounty.name\ncountyfp\nDem_Desc\nedr\ngrad.year\ngrad.year.covid\nGender\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\nHomelessIndicator\neconomic.status\npseo.participant\nSpecialEdStatus\nnon.english.home\nRaceEthnicity\nn.years.attended\nACTCompositeScore\nap.exam\ntotal.cte.courses.taken\nACTE-SPED\nAgriculture, Food, and Natural Resources\nArchitecture & Construction\nArts, A/V Technology & Communication\nBusiness, Management & Administrative\nDiversified\nEducation & Training\nFinance\nGovernment & Public Administration\nHealth Science\nHospitality & Tourism\nHuman Services\nInformation Technology\nLaw, Public Safety & Security\nManufacturing\nMarketing\nProgram Area (Diversified)\nScience, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics\nSTEM\nTransportation, Distribution & Logistics\nWork Experience-Handicapped\nWork Experience-Handicapped (16-20+ on IEP)\nWork Experience/Career Exploration (age 14-15 on I\nWork-Experience-Disadvantaged\nYouth Apprenticeship\n\n\n\n\n5356619\n103290\nLITTLE FALLS SENIOR HIGH\nMorrison\n097\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 5 - North Central\n2013\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\n1\n0\n0\nWhite\n3\n21\n0\n5\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1506121\n201946\nPINE CITY AREA LEARNING CENTER\nPine\n115\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7E- East Central\n2022\nPost-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n1\n0\n0\n0\nUnknown\n3\nNA\n0\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1456500\n44383\nEAGLE VALLEY SECONDARY\nTodd\n153\nTown/rural mix\nEDR 5 - North Central\n2008\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n0\nNA\n0\n0\nHispanic\n1\nNA\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n10870895\n100018\nSPECIAL EDUCATION FACILITIES\nStearns\n145\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7W- Central\n2015\nPre-covid grad\nM\nN\nN\n1\n0\n1\n1\nHispanic\n6\nNA\n0\n14\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n4\n0\n5\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1877865\n160881\nMONTICELLO SENIOR HIGH\nWright\n171\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7W- Central\n2016\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n1\n0\n0\n0\nWhite\n3\n14\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1323083\n160874\nMONTICELLO SENIOR HIGH\nWright\n171\nUrban/town/rural mix\nEDR 7W- Central\n2009\nPre-covid grad\nF\nN\nN\n0\nNA\n0\n0\nWhite\n3\n23\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nPersonID\n\n\nK12OrganizationID\n\n\nOrganizationName\n\n\ncounty.name\n\n\ncountyfp\n\n\nDem_Desc\n\n\nedr\n\n\ngrad.year\n\n\ngrad.year.covid\n\n\nGender\n\n\nLimitedEnglishProficiencyIndicator\n\n\nHomelessIndicator\n\n\neconomic.status\n\n\npseo.participant\n\n\nSpecialEdStatus\n\n\nnon.english.home\n\n\nRaceEthnicity\n\n\nn.years.attended\n\n\nACTCompositeScore\n\n\nap.exam\n\n\ntotal.cte.courses.taken\n\n\nACTE-SPED\n\n\nAgriculture, Food, and Natural Resources\n\n\nArchitecture & Construction\n\n\nArts, A/V Technology & Communication\n\n\nBusiness, Management & Administrative\n\n\nDiversified\n\n\nEducation & Training\n\n\nFinance\n\n\nGovernment & Public Administration\n\n\nHealth Science\n\n\nHospitality & Tourism\n\n\nHuman Services\n\n\nInformation Technology\n\n\nLaw, Public Safety & Security\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\nMarketing\n\n\nProgram Area (Diversified)\n\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics\n\n\nSTEM\n\n\nTransportation, Distribution & Logistics\n\n\nWork Experience-Handicapped\n\n\nWork Experience-Handicapped (16-20+ on IEP)\n\n\nWork Experience/Career Exploration (age 14-15 on I\n\n\nWork-Experience-Disadvantaged\n\n\nYouth Apprenticeship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter joining the CTE enrollment data with the master dataset we continue to have 137,622 with an updated number of 46 columns."

This is a high standard deviation meaning there are values quite far from the mean.\nThe second row of the table shows the average number of CTE courses taken by individuals who took at least one CTE course. The average jumps up a bit to 4.84 with a standard deviation of 3.56.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the distribution of CTE courses taken by individuals. This shows that a a large majority of students take 10 courses or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp next is to see if the percentage of students taking a CTE course varies significantly by RUCA group.\nThere is a significant difference in whether a student has taken at least one CTE course and their high school county RUCA category. Although 84% of all graduates took at least one CTE course, that percentage is highest in urban/town/rural mix counties with 85%.\nOf those students that took at least 1 CTE course, the average number of CTE courses taken ranged from 5.1 in our entirely urban districts to 4.6 in town/rural mix districts.\n\n\nRUCA TableRUCA Cross-tabs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   Cell Contents\n|-------------------------|\n|                       N |\n|              Expected N |\n|           N / Row Total |\n|-------------------------|\n\n \nTotal Observations in Table:  137622 \n\n \n                         | cte.yes.no.ruca$cte.yes \ncte.yes.no.ruca$Dem_Desc |        No |       Yes | Row Total | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n          Entirely urban |      5049 |     20597 |     25646 | \n                         |  4112.022 | 21533.978 |           | \n                         |     0.197 |     0.803 |     0.186 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n          Town/rural mix |      4684 |     24468 |     29152 | \n                         |  4674.166 | 24477.834 |           | \n                         |     0.161 |     0.839 |     0.212 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n    Urban/town/rural mix |     12333 |     70491 |     82824 | \n                         | 13279.813 | 69544.187 |           | \n                         |     0.149 |     0.851 |     0.602 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n            Column Total |     22066 |    115556 |    137622 | \n-------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n\n \nStatistics for All Table Factors\n\n\nPearson's Chi-squared test \n------------------------------------------------------------\nChi^2 =  334.6925     d.f. =  2     p =  2.101141e-73"

    "text": "Summary - CareerCluster of CTE courses taken\nLet’s dig into the breadth of CTE course concentrations a graduate would take by looking at the proportion of graduates that took at least one course within a concentration.\nThe table below shows that a third of all graduates took a CTE course in Transportation, Distribution & Logistics, and Human Services, followed by 27% in Manufacturing, and 25% in each Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will take a look at the breakdown of the number of times a CTE courses has been taken within a CareerCluster for each PersonID. I expect there to be a lot of variation in this data since different schools might focus on different types of CTE offerings depending on the local employment makeup.\nFirst, lets look at the concentrations of courses taken across CareerClusters.\nNot surprisingly, Transportation, Distribution & Logistics was the careercluster with the highest percentage of courses taken with 20.6%. This was followed by manfacturing with 12.4% and architecture and construction with 11.2% of CTE courses taken in that CareerCluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLets see how this looks broken down by county.\nThe county maps do show some differences in percentages across career clusters. Agriculture, food and natural resources had higher percentages taken in the western and central counties. Manufacturing was taken at a higher percentage in the northern and southern counties. Human services and transportation, distribution & logistics was pretty standard across all."
